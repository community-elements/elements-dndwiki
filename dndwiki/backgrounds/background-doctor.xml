			<p>The world's doctors come in many shapes and sizes. There are apothecaries, shamans, field medics; a lot more variety exists beyond the standard cleric healer of faith. These doctors are better known for their additional social aspect of communicating with patients as well as often treating their ailments through an accessible and nonmagical procedure. Doctors also perform invasive procedures to save lives, like conducting surgeries or helping induce birth. For the most part, doctors are expected to be paragons of good. They are beholden to a code that ensures they do no harm and try their very best to help patients. As such, it should come as no surprise that they often encounter the worst in humanity. Moral issues tail them around as purveyors of a limited good. Temptations can lead a doctor astray and easily make them into a monster.</p>
            <p class="indent">When creating your doctor character, consider what sort of doctor they are. Traveling doctors are not unheard of and welcomed often as a benign sight. Of course, there lie rotten apples with every orchard, and your character could very well be a false doctor who extorts money from their patients. Or are you perhaps a grizzled veteran who has seen and treated many, vowing only to go further? Do you discriminate between patients, choosing only to treat certain races or groups? Do you have more knowledge treating individuals of these specific races over other races? What is your special doctor touch? There are the din√©, medicine men who specialize in warding off evil spirits, as well as the alchemists of the east who craft potions of alleged immortality.</p>
            <p class="indent">What drives your doctor? Money? Fame? Doctors are generally recognized one way or another within communities where they practice as figures of authority. Have they maybe experienced crippling illness themselves, spurring them into this field? Due to the strain of the work, doctors may disassociate themselves from patients or choose to treat everyone professionally. Consider how your character deals with all the death they may have seen, as well as any miracles of medicine they may have witnessed. They, above all others, know the fragility of life and how easily it can be forgotten. In a world where everyone can not pay for resurrection spells or even minor curative magic, a doctor can be the final arbiter between who lives and who dies.</p>

			<h5>FEILD OF PRACTICE</h5>

			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Doctors come from many walks of life. Some may be well educated while others may have learned how to be a doctor through the passing down of knowledge from one generation to another, while others may have had to start from scratch and have had to learn as they doctored. Regardless, many doctors are troubled by harrowing events they bore witness to. Some are shockingly pragmatic, with an "it may not be pretty, but you'll live" approach to problems. Many are seemingly tireless, hard-working individuals. Some can be inspiring souls, with a deep appreciation, not only for life, but for the person who is alive as well.</p>

			<p>However you may have earned your prestige or title as a doctor, you are now known to be a person who has sworn to do their very best to save lives. Your certification as a doctor makes others see you as a nonpartisan who often does what is right, no matter the case. In instances where there may be fractious conflict between neighbors or borders, you, as a doctor, may be the ideal figure to ask to mediate. If you require crossing into dangerous territory, like one of war or feud, authorities will be more lenient on your plea due to your profession providing ample reason in their eyes. This is not to say you will always get a free pass, as the respect owed to doctors is not always a given in society. Additionally, if your plea contradicts the role of a doctor, you may arouse more suspicion than usual.</p>

			<p>Choose a creature type besides humanoid to be a specialized doctor of. You are generally aware of what substances are helpful or harmful to members within the species of that type. If you encounter new species, you can put together a rough idea of how old knowledge affects new and fascinating creatures. Spending time to study a creature lets you get a better and more accurate idea of minute details to treat issues that might ail them, as well as what ailments can develop. Other doctors may not take you as seriously, but anyone who has an important animal, such as a knight's steed or a caster's familiar, will have deep respect for you, for acknowledging that their creature is worth saving.</p>
