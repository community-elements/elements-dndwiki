			<p>Those who follow the Way of the Beast are akin to druids in many ways. They greatly revere animals, and mold their techniques after them. This lends them many unique fighting styles, known as "stances". In these stances, powered by ki, they are capable of great feats even most other monks cannot attempt.</p>
