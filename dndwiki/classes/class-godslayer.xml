        <description>
            <p>He called to charge, the foolish lesser deity. His clerics and paladins charged. There is a whinny from the sudden steeds before several fall flat on their faces or toss off their rider. Their legs had been removed from right under then. A series of large blades point to the deity, who is beginning to grasp the urgency of the situation. The wielders of the winning hand said only three words.</p>
            <center>
                <p><i>"No more gods."</i></p>
            </center>
            <h4>Path of Blasphemy</h4>
            <p>The godslayers were once all servants of the gods, similar to paladins. But, unlike the oathkeepers, they designed to seek out and destroy other divine beings instead. They did not hunt your simple fiends, no. They hunted the devils in charge. Godslayers of evil deities were known to have stripped the wings off angels and silence their seraphic voices. These wars were unceasing, and the godslayers were always at the forefront for their hirer. However, soon, the brunt of the task came to bear down on their shoulders. They were now being forced to just kill one another. Many, in having killed for their gods, were made scapegoats to damning curses or worse. They could not longer rejoin the world as they once had, and for many, this was their death sentence. People saw them to be heretics. Their own eyes opened and saw the gods forsake them. With renewed rage and purpose, they no longer would shackle themselves to divinity like a dog. No, they would go and destroy those who dared use them and then toss them away like pawns.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A Godslayer</h4>
            <p>What path did your character take to reach this forsaken status? Were they born cursed? Did they commit sacrilege and get cursed? Did a religious body hex them for an act the followers found abominable? Were they once devout knights of an order, only to be ousted by corruption and underhanded means? Or, were they disillusioned with fealty to deities that played with human lives like toys?</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a godslayer quickly by following these suggestions: First, either Constitution or Strength should be your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. Second, choose the outlander background.</p>

You can no longer be healed by means of spells. You become immune to being charmed and you gain proficiency in the Insight skill. If you already have proficiency in this skill, your proficiency bonus is instead doubled for any ability check you make that uses Insight.</p>
