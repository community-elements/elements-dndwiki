            <p>A man flips his knife, over and over again. Suddenly it disappears, and a purple blade appears in the stomach of the man behind him. Someone grabs the dagger, thinking the man to be vulnerable, but the knife disappears in his hand. As the glowing weapon is stabbed through his skull, he realizes who he was dealing with as the world goes black.</p>
            <h4>Psychic Combatant</h4>
            <p>The psiblade is a warrior who specializes in a martial method that combine one's natural psychic abilities with fighting training to create a unique and unpredictable technique. A psychic combatant usually is member of a race that have already natural predisposition to develop psychic abilities, being psiblades very common between giths for example. However, anyone with enough mental prowess can learn the secrets of psionics and learn how to fight with them becoming a psiblade, with the proper training.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A PSIBLADE</h4>
            <p>When creating a psiblade, answer a few questions: how did you discovered your psychic abilities? Did you have been trained by someone or they have awakened spontaneously as you grew older? Why did you become a psychic warrior? To protect yourself using your new found powers and as means to survival, or are you follower of a long forgotten martial tradition?</p>
            <p class="indent">What's your place in the world, and why did you become an adventurer? You want just to discover and hone more and more your powers, or do you have a bigger goal in mind?</p>

            <p>You can make a Psiblade quickly by following these suggestions. First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity or Strength, depending on the type of weapon you intend to choose.

As an action, you can move a willing creature or object within your telekinetic push range up 10 feet for each Intelligence modifier point you have. The target can't weight more than 10 pounds for each level you have on this class. Using this feature requires concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell). At the start of each of your turns, you need to spend your action keeping control over the moved object or creature, otherwise the creature or object will fall on the ground (if it is suspended) and you will lose your grasp. </p>
            <p class="indent">Starting at 13th level, you can also try to move a unwillingly creature as an action. Doing so requires a grapple contest, using your Intelligence modifier instead of your Strength. On a success, you can move the target up to 10 feet to any direction. In other aspects, this functions in the same way as a regular grapple. </p>
            <p class="indent">When you reach the 17th level, you can try to crush objects and creatures grasped by your telekinesis. You can choose to deal damage equal to your psychic damage die in each of the turns a creature or object ends grappled by it. The damage is force.</p>
