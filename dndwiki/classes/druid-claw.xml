			<p>The Circle of the Claw has a focus on the use of beast form, and stronger forms of it instead of spells. It can stay in beast form for a long time, but has severe drawbacks when they fall out of it in order to discourage abusing the hit point generation it can provide. The point of this subclass is to fill a type of character who prefers to stay in their beast form(s) but is not nearly as good at other magics than other druids. </p>

			<p>The druid has improved control over the bestial forms which allows them to keep their Dexterity modifier instead of their Charisma modifier, as well as use of finesse while in beast form. Also, they have access to a greater form of wild shape which allows them to stay in their forms indefinitely, only ending the form if it is reduced to 0 hit points. When the form ends, they can not go back into a form unless they succeeds on a DC 15 Constitution check. They can freely enter a form again after a long rest.</p>
