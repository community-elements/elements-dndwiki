			<h5>Victory Day</h5>
			<p>A battle rages on the plains, the orcs slowly pushing the empire's soldiers back foot by foot. Suddenly a lone warrior rushes into the fray from the side, cutting a swath of death and gore into the orcish lines. The warrior, rallying the troops, leads them to victory.</p>
			<h5>Unseen Victory</h5>
			<p>The Goliath and the Gnome are alone in the arena, ready for the final fight of the tournament. Everyone knows who the winner will be, but the fight starts anyway. The Goliath swings its club at the poor creature, only to find that he isn't there. The gnome rushes the Goliath's legs, and starts cutting with unimaginable speed, until the giant can no longer stand. Pressing his glaive to his opponent's neck, the judge calls the fight.</p>
			<h5>Dance of Death</h5>
			<p>A lone woman waits in the forest for the bandits to pass, longbow drawn. Suddenly they appear, and she releases the arrow, and three more after that. Four bandits fall before they realize that they are being attacked, but the women is already on the road, swinging her scimitars all around, killing bandits all in range. Only the leader remains, who runs but two steps before finding a dagger in his heart.</p>
			<h5>The Legend</h5>
