        <description>
            <p>A human holding a quarterstaff puts a hand on the shoulder of a bulky paladin whose armour starts to glow as he breathes a word of gratitude before charging back into the fray. Darkness clouds the eyes of an elf who steps over the body of a fallen friend and with a single touch of a finger makes the culprit crumble to the ground. Rushing past the legs of enemies and allies a halfling comes to the aid of a fallen friend and with gentle attention helps them back to their feet. A Fateweaver has learned the secrets of life and holds the scales of fate in their hand. With or without magic they tip the scales of fate to their will and determine whether a creature lives or dies. Their magic has roots in the very fabric of creation bringing them to the crossroads of destiny.</p>
            <h4>Guardians of Life</h4>
            <p>Through study and training a fateweaver has refined their magical skills to be able to aid those in need better than anyone. Drawing from a pool of healing magic fateweavers can channel life through their touch. With powerful wards they can spare their friends, with quick hands they can patch up those in need, with blades they bring enemies to their ends, with a touch they can knock someone off their feet. They train to overcome death or bring it if they so wish. Angels of Death, fateweavers are also adapt melee fighters who can tip the scales in their favour with magic blades and crippling blows.</p>
            <h4>Balanced Duality</h4>
            <p>Dealing with these dual forces of life and death fateweavers can be found on every end of the spectrum involved in the circle of life. The very best and the very worst can come from their capabilities and with little but themselves to govern them it is their personality that fully drives them to make the decisions that lie within their powers. Their reputation is one of wisdom and where they arrive they are often perceived with a mixture of respect and fear. Though they are few, their ability is well known and revered. Where a fateweaver goes rumors can be expected to trail behind them and linger long after they have gone.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A FATEWEAVER</h4>
            <p>When you create a Fateweaver, it is most important to consider how you obtained your skills. Is it through magical predisposition or through rigorous study of the human body? Did you want to help those in need of those in need of your skills or are you simply doing it because you can. Secondly the knowledge you have can be used for healing, but also for harming. What focus do you have and how do you deal with people requiring your services?</p>
            <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>

			<p>See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and below for the Fateweaverâ€™s spell list.</p>
			<h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
			<p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the Fateweaver spell list. You learn additional Fateweaver cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Fateweaver table.</p>
			<h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
			<p>The Fateweaver table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these Fateweaver spells, you must expend a slot of the spellâ€™s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st level spell cure wounds and have a 1st level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.</p>
			<h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
			<p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Fateweaver spell list. The Spells Known column of the Fateweaver table shows when you learn more Fateweaver spells of your choice Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Fateweaver spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Fateweaver spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Fateweaver spells. Your power comes from training and studying. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Fateweaver spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
			</center>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
			<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your Fateweaver spells.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You can channel the energy and magic of life through the touch of your fingers, magically healing them. You have a pool of healing points that replenishes when you take a long rest. This pool of healing points is equal to your Fateweaver level x 10. This pool increases to 12 x your level at 5th level, 15 x your level at 9th level, 18 x your level at 13th level and 20 x your level at 18th level As an action, you can touch a creature and channel energy from a pool of healing points into the creature you touch to restore the same number of hitpoints, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool. Alternatively, you can spend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralise one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of your Healing points, provided you spend the cost for each disease or poison in the total you spend. Fateweavers can spend 10 healing points to restore a spell slot, in order to restore higher spell slots 10 healing points per level will be spent, no action required. This feature has no effect on constructs.</p>
