			<p>Rune dwarfs, also known as Ruhn Kadan (meaning sons of rune/or rune son) are Dwarfs gifted by the gods with the mark of rune. This gift passes from son to son during birth; granting each and every one of them an uncanny resistance against magic, to a certain limit. However, these same runes limit the dwarfs to have difficulty while casting greater spells, forcing them to commit to a more direct way of combat.</p>
