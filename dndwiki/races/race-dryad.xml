			<p class="flavor">D is for Dryad, creep softly to see. If she hears you or sees you, she'll turn into a tree.</p>
			<p style="text-align:right">â€”Excerpt from <i>Creatures of the Wilds</i>.</p>
			<h4>PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION</h4>
			<p>Dryads resemble highly humanoid beings only made out of smooth, brown-green wood, and with grass and leaves for hair. In some cases you will see that some Dryad's have both hair and eye's that change with the seasons.</p>
			<h4>HISTORY</h4>
			<p>Not many know the origin of Dryads. The majority of what is known about these amazing creatures is that they prefer to stay in the woods where they can observe nature and be at peace. It is also known that if the forest is brought to danger most of the Tree-Kin will do their best to defend the forest.</p>
			<h4>SOCIETY</h4>
			<p>Although most Dryad's prefer to stay away from town's and cities they thrive with each other in the forest. The Dryad's happily go day to day talking with other Dryad's and Fey Folk.</p>
			<h4>DRYAD NAMES</h4>
			<p>A Dryad takes their name from something in Nature or a name that their parent chooses.</p>
			<p>
				<b>Male: </b>Dryope, Erato, Eurydice<br/>
				<b>Female: </b>Chrysopeleia, Phigalia, Tithorea
